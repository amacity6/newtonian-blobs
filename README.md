This game was created in Scratch for a Science Olympiad competition called Game On. I was given one hour to program a mini-game given a random game type and theme.
In this case, the game was the "collection" type and the theme was physics. It won a second place medal at a regional competition.
For easy viewing, I have converted the Scratch file to HTML using TurboWarp Packager, at https://packager.turbowarp.org/.
